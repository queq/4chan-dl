Yet Another 4chan Thread Image Downloader (YANFTID)
=======

YANFTID is a command-only program that makes filling reaction folders easier.

Usage
------
First of all, you should grant execute permission to the file:

`$ cd /path/to/yanftid && chmod a+x yanftid`

And you're ready to go!

`$ ./yanftid -i <thread URL> -o <download path>`


TODO:
------

* Make a fancier interface (perhaps showing the thread's OP, or redirecting to archives in case of 404ing)
* Show individual file and/or overall progress
* Create a folder, named after thread number or OP
